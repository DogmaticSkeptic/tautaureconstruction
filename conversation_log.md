# Conversation Log - 2025-02-05

## Initial Context
User shared LoadData.py file for analysis and potential modifications.

## Key Points Discussed:
1. File contains particle physics data analysis code
2. Code processes truth and reconstructed particle data
3. Includes momentum calculations, plotting, and optimization
4. Currently set to process 100 events (n_events = 100)

## Physics Analysis - Cos Theta Calculations

### Coordinate System Definition
The analysis defines a special coordinate system {r̂, n̂, k̂} in the tau-tau rest frame:
- k̂: Direction of the tau- momentum
- r̂: Perpendicular component to k̂ in the beam direction (z-axis)
- n̂: Cross product of k̂ and r̂ (normal to the decay plane)

### Angular Distributions
The code calculates three angular components for each pion:
1. cosθᵣ: Projection along r̂ axis
2. cosθₙ: Projection along n̂ axis
3. cosθₖ: Projection along k̂ axis

### Physics Significance
These cosines are used to study:
- Tau spin correlations
- Decay dynamics
- Possible CP-violating effects
- Detector performance validation

### Visualization
Results are plotted using ratio plots showing:
- Truth vs reconstructed cosθ values
- Reconstruction accuracy

## Potential Next Steps:
- Increase number of events processed
- Add additional analysis metrics
- Optimize performance
- Add error handling
- Create unit tests

## Suggested Commands:
```bash
git add conversation_log.md
git commit -m "Added physics explanation of cos theta calculations"
```
