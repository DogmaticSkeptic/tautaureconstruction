# Conversation Log - 2025-02-05

## Initial Context
User shared LoadData.py file for analysis and potential modifications.

## Key Points Discussed:
1. File contains particle physics data analysis code
2. Code processes truth and reconstructed particle data
3. Includes momentum calculations, plotting, and optimization
4. Currently set to process 100 events (n_events = 100)

## Potential Next Steps:
- Increase number of events processed
- Add additional analysis metrics
- Optimize performance
- Add error handling
- Create unit tests

## Suggested Commands:
```bash
git add conversation_log.md
git commit -m "Added conversation log capturing analysis discussion"
```
